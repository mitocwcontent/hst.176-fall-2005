Course Meeting Times
--------------------

Lectures: 2 sessions / week, 3 hours / session

Overview
--------

Although this is an introductory immunology course, we will deal with the subject in quite some detail which will build as the course progresses. Immunological aspects of disease will be covered in the classroom as well as in case-based tutorial sessions, and in evening clinical discussions at selected teaching hospitals.

Tutorials
---------

Apart from the lectures there will be seven tutorial sessions at which attendance is required. At these sessions immunologically relevant clinical cases will be discussed. The goal will be to use these sessions to review and revise basic immunological issues as well as to get a feel for disease processes. Please see the section in the camel regarding the clinical curriculum.

There will be five tutorial groups each of which will be led by a faculty tutor. Students and individual tutors will remain in the same tutorial group for the duration of the course.

Texts
-----

A "basic" textbook and a clinical textbook are recommended. The recommended books are:

Abbas, Abul K., and Andrew Lichtman. _Cellular and Molecular Immunology_. 6th ed. Philadelphia, PA: Saunders, 2005. ISBN: 9781416023890.

 Rosen, Fred, and Raif Geha. _Case Studies in Immunology: A Clinical Companion_. 4th ed. New York, NY: Garland Pub., 2004. ISBN: 9780815341024. (Paperback)

Reading of textbook chapters before the class is strongly recommended. For many of the lectures the contents of the slides are summarized in the course camel. The current edition of the following book may also be used:

 Janeway, Charles A., et al. _Immunobiology: The Immune System in Health and Disease_. New York, NY: Garland Science, 2004. ISBN: 9780443073106.

Exams and Grades
----------------

Two short quizzes are planned early in the course to facilitate acquisition of the "language of immunology." There will be a Mid-term as well as a Final examination (short answers and brief essays). Grades will be based primarily on performance in the quizzes and examinations.
